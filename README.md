# Metagenomics

The R script in the repository is used to analyze taxonomy of metagenomics datasets. 

The input file is generated after QC, trimming adapters, human DNA fliter out(BMTagger), genome assembly(IDBA_UD, MEGAHIT, MetaVilvet), ORF prediction(Prodigal), alignment to NCBI database (DIAMOND, MEGAN).

Test data will be provided after the PI published the paper.
